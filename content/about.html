> A Somerset based florist who will provide you with a bespoke service, with delicately
> and sensitively designed flowers, whatever the occasion. 

Flowers of the Hesperides aims to provide you with perfect, beautiful flowers, designed
individually and specifically for you. No two arrangements will ever be the same.

Although we're based in Somerset, having family all over the South of England we
love to travel and are more than happy to bring beautiful flowers to you.

I'm Becky, the owner and founder of Flowers of the Hesperides.
I grew up in Cambridge, then moved to London and now live in North Somerset,
near beautiful Bath and bustling Bristol.

Having completed a degree in Classics and a Diploma in Law, the prospect of being
trapped in an office spurred me on to quit the City and move to the countryside
(wellies weren't so useful in London) and I happened upon a career course in floristry.
I haven't looked back since.

Growing up, I was surrounded by flowers and follow in the footsteps of generations
of flower arrangers. My grandmother recently said that the joy of flowers is that
no two people will ever do the same design, but rather it's the flowers that choose
how they want to sit. This is a philosophy I follow and build my business on.

Why Hesperides?
---------------

Having studied Classics and Ancient Languages for most of my life, I was keen to
draw on the beauty of the classical world. 'Hesperides' originates from the Ancient
Greek word for 'Evening' and 'Evening Star', which also links to Venus, the
Goddess of Love. Evening is a time of day for romance and relaxation. In summer,
the word evokes balmy air and the scents of flowers after a long day in the sun.
In winter, it's the cosiness of a log fire and warm-coloured flowers.

The Hesperides were Nymphs who took care of the Orchard of Hera, the queen of the
Ancient Gods. The orchard was based in the West (as I now am), where golden apples
grew and gave immortality. The well-known myth of the Judgement of Paris has its
setting here too, where an apple is inscribed "to the most beautiful" and Paris
must give it to one goddess of transcendent beauty.

The Hesperides featured again in the art and writing of the Renaissance, another
era of romance and poetics.

It is the garden of romance, of beauty and love.
